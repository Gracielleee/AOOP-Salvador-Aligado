A Data Access Object (DAO) in Java is a design pattern used to abstract and encapsulate all access to a data source. 
It separates the application's business logic from the persistence layer, providing an abstract interface for data interaction. 
This promotes loose coupling, improves code maintainability, and allows for easier switching between different data sources without
affecting the rest of the application.


DAOs typically define standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, hiding the underlying data access mechanisms. 
They can interact with various data sources such as relational databases, external services, or other persistence mechanisms.
